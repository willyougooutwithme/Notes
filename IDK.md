(after the medicines have started working)  

**I don’t feel as lonely anymore.**  
I don't have as many nightmares.  
I don't feel as overwhelmed by being alone, but still think about my ex, which causes some trauma.  
I have successfully countered doom scrolling by **uninstalling Instagram, Snapchat, and other social media apps.**  
I temporarily uninstalled the dating app but reinstalled it again.  
Hallucinations have decreased, but I still see black figures in the corner of my eyes.  
I still crave affection and attention.  
**I am a little more agitated, but also calm.**  
The medicine has reduced the **brain fog** I used to have (feeling of inability to see others and always thinking "what's wrong with me" or "why am I like this").  
With the removal of brain fog, I can now see people around me in a different perspective.  
People I used to talk to and mix with are now starting to get on my nerves.  
**Beige flags I used to ignore are now becoming red flags**, and I am unsure if this is due to my new perspective or the medicine.

**Medicines seem to be losing efficacy**, affecting my mood negatively.  
No crankiness, but **heightened sensitivity to both happiness and sadness.**  
Thinking about the ex, not with guilt but reflecting on her behavior:  
Feeling used as a backup despite efforts to reconcile.  
Remembering happy times with her but also recognizing a shift in her behavior after she started psychiatric medication (2022 end).  

**Personal experience with psychiatric medication from my ex's therapist in 2023:** Took it for two sessions but stopped due to emotional numbness, particularly toward loved ones (pet dog and ex).  

Instagram Usage:  
**Resumed using Instagram** but limited usage to 1 hour daily.  
Certain reels trigger bursts of laughter, likely due to heightened happiness sensitivity.  

A close friend believes that depression medication doesn't work, seeing it as a dopamine substitute for people unable to seek it elsewhere, labeling them as "cowards."  

Series Watching:  
Started and finished a series to pass time and disconnect from others, which brought happiness.

## 8th January 2024
I’m struggling to put this into words, but I feel so alone, hurt, and humiliated—like I don’t belong here and should just disappear. Today, I’m feeling really low, even with my medications. It got so bad that I pressed a cold knife against my skin, but I managed to put it back on the shelf. I’ve started missing my ex again. Honestly, I haven’t stopped missing her these past few months, but today, everything seems to remind me of her. I just want to sleep peacefully, but the medicines don’t seem to be helping. 

Listening to other people’s problems and offering them a little bit of advice seems to lessen these feelings

## 24th January 2025  

**Lately, I’ve been feeling better overall**, but I’ve started thinking about my ex again. In late December and early January, I wasn’t dwelling on her much, but now, **memories of the happy moments we shared have been surfacing more often.** I’ve been reflecting on how good she made me feel and wondering if I unknowingly did something to set off the chain of events that led to our breakup. However, at the end of the day, it was her choice to move on and be with someone else, even while insisting that I still held significance in her life. **I haven’t been able to forgive her for that or fully let go of the resentment.** I want to move on, but my mind keeps circling back to it, refusing to let it go.  

### On another note, the medicine I’m taking has cleared up my **brain fog**, and I feel like I’m seeing the people in my life from a new perspective. 
**It’s been unsettling in some ways.** One friend dismissed my medication as just “dopamine therapy,” as if I’m only taking it for a quick happiness fix, which stung a bit. 

Another person, whom I trusted deeply, and thought would always be there for me, seemed to forget about me completely once they got into a relationship. **It felt like I stopped existing to them.** 
### Amid all this, the only positive connection I’ve recently formed is with my cousin, Mimi. We’ve always been close, and in every family gathering, I’d find her there—she made those events tolerable. Although we lost touch a couple of times, in the last few months, we’ve reconnected, and it feels like I’ve known her forever (for all intents and purposes, I really do, lmao). She and my Meaw Shona have been the only bright spots I can look to lately.

### Additionally, I’ve started reaching out to old friends. I’m not entirely sure why—maybe it’s just for a sense of familiarity. 

### Lastly, I’ve noticed that my medicines affect my mood differently throughout the day. The **afternoon dose tends to lift my spirits**, but the night dose has the opposite effect—it makes me sad and overthink everything. Even when I’m sleepy, I struggle to fall asleep because my mind won’t stop racing.
