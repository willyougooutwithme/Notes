### *Types of Pollution*
#### 1. *Air Pollution*
- *Definition*: Contaminants in the atmosphere harmful to living beings.
- *Causes*: 
  - Transport, industries, mining, and burning fossil fuels.
  - Primary pollutants: Directly emitted (e.g., sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide).
  - Secondary pollutants: Formed by reactions (e.g., ozone, nitrous oxide).

#### 2. *Water Pollution*
- *Definition*: Contaminants in water harmful to life.
- *Sources*:
  - Sewage: Causes oxygen depletion and dead zones.
  - Industrial chemicals: Toxic substances entering food chains.
  - Surface runoff: Carries pesticides and fertilizers, leading to eutrophication.
  - Oil spills: Devastating effects on marine life.

#### 3. *Soil Pollution*
- *Definition*: Contaminants reduce soil quality and make it unfit for use.
- *Causes*:
  - Organic pollutants: Biodegradable (e.g., waste from animals, farms).
  - Inorganic pollutants: Metals, pesticides, fertilizers, industrial sludge.
  - Radioactive waste: From nuclear plants and weapons.

#### 4. *Radiation Pollution*
- *Definition*: Harmful radiation from radioactive substances.
- *Types*:
  - Non-ionizing: Less harmful (e.g., microwaves, UV radiation).
  - Ionizing: Highly harmful (e.g., from nuclear explosions, isotopes).
- *Effects*: Cancer, DNA damage, severe health issues.

#### 5. *Noise Pollution*
- *Definition*: Unwanted sounds causing annoyance and health problems.
- *Sources*:
  - Transportation: Traffic, trains, airplanes.
  - Industries: Machinery in factories.
  - Health impacts: Stress, hearing loss, hypertension.

### *Types of Pollutants*
- *Primary Pollutants*: Directly released (e.g., dust, carbon monoxide).
- *Secondary Pollutants*: Formed in the atmosphere (e.g., ozone).
- *Biodegradable*: Break down naturally (e.g., sewage, farm waste).
- *Non-biodegradable*: Persist in the environment (e.g., plastic, metals).
- *Natural*: Emissions from volcanic eruptions, forest fires.
- *Anthropogenic*: Human-caused (e.g., industrial emissions, pesticides).

### *Effects of Pollution*
- Health hazards: Respiratory issues, cancer, mental stress.
- Environmental impact: Habitat destruction, biodiversity loss, ecosystem damage.
