**Answer:**  
Reinforcement learning is characterized by:  
1. **Interaction with the environment:** The agent interacts with the environment and learns from the feedback received.  
2. **Reward-based learning:** The agent receives rewards for correct actions and penalties for incorrect actions.  
3. **Goal-oriented behavior:** The agent aims to maximize cumulative rewards over time.  
4. **Exploration vs. Exploitation trade-off:** The agent must explore new actions to find better strategies while exploiting known actions for rewards.

---

### **Question 6**  
**Explain 'Naive' in a Naive Bayes Algorithm.**  
**Answer:**  
The "naive" assumption in the Naive Bayes algorithm refers to the assumption of **conditional independence** between features. It assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is independent of other features.  

For example, while classifying emails as spam or not spam, Naive Bayes assumes that the occurrence of words like "free" and "win" are independent, even though they often appear together in spam emails.
