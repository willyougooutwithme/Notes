## Group B (Short Answer Type)

**Question 1 - Explain the Nyquist Sampling Theorem and calculate the sampling frequency for a signal ranging from 50 Hz to 8 kHz**  

**Answer** -  
The Nyquist Sampling Theorem states that to accurately represent an analog signal in digital form, the signal must be sampled at a rate that is at least twice the highest frequency component present in the signal. This is known as the Nyquist rate. If this condition is not met, aliasing will occur, resulting in signal distortion.  

For a signal with a frequency range from 50 Hz to 8 kHz, the highest frequency component is 8 kHz.  
According to the theorem:  
Sampling frequency = 2 × Highest frequency = 2 × 8000 = 16,000 Hz (16 kHz).

**Question 20 - What is the aspect ratio? Calculate the resolution of a monitor with a diagonal of 15 inches and an aspect ratio of 16:9.**  

**Answer** -  
**Aspect Ratio**:  
The aspect ratio is the proportional relationship between the width and height of a display or image. For example, an aspect ratio of 16:9 means the width is 16 units, and the height is 9 units.  

**Calculation**:  
1. **Diagonal**: 15 inches.  
2. **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9.  

Let the width be \(16x\) and height be \(9x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem:  
```math

[(16x)^2 + (9x)^2 = (15)^2  ]]
```
```math
[256x^2 + 81x^2 = 225  ]
```
```math
[337x^2 = 225  ]
```
```math
[x^2 = \frac{225}{337}]
```
```math
[x = \sqrt{\frac{225}{337}} \approx 0.816]
```

Width = $\(16x = 16 \times 0.816 \approx 13.06\)$ inches.  
Height = $\(9x = 9 \times 0.816 \approx 7.34\)$ inches.  

Assuming a resolution of **85 DPI (dots per inch)**:  
Width resolution = $\(13.06 \times 85 \approx 1110\)$ pixels.  
Height resolution = $\(7.34 \times 85 \approx 624\)$ pixels.  

**Resolution**: Approximately **1110 × 624 pixels**.

**Question 6 - Write in detail about the Huffman coding process, using a given set of characters and probabilities.**  

**Answer** -  
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression technique that assigns variable-length binary codes to input characters based on their frequencies or probabilities. Characters with higher frequencies are assigned shorter codes, while less frequent characters receive longer codes, thereby minimizing the overall data size.  

**Steps in the Huffman Coding Process**:  
1. **Frequency Calculation**:  
   - Calculate the frequency or probability of each character in the input data.  

2. **Create Nodes**:

3. **Build the Huffman Tree**:  
   - Combine the two nodes with the lowest frequencies into a new node.  
   - Assign the combined frequency to this new node.  
   - Repeat the process until there is only one node, which becomes the root of the tree.  

4. **Assign Binary Codes**:  
   - Traverse the tree from root to leaf, assigning "0" to the left branch and "1" to the right branch.  
   - The resulting paths from the root to each leaf give the binary codes for the characters.  

**Example**:  
Given characters with probabilities: A (0.35), B (0.17), C (0.17), D (0.16), E (0.15):  
- Combine D (0.16) and E (0.15) → New node (0.31).  
- Combine B (0.17) and C (0.17) → New node (0.34).  
- Combine (0.31) and (0.34) → New node (0.65).  
- Combine (0.35) and (0.65) → Root node (1.00).  

Resulting codes:  
- A: 0, B: 110, C: 111, D: 100, E: 101.

**Question 10 - Describe the Luma-Chroma Transmission Principle and its advantages in video signals.**  

**Answer** -  
The **Luma-Chroma Transmission Principle** separates video information into luminance (luma) and chrominance (chroma) components.  

1. **Luminance (Luma)**:

### **Question 17 - Describe the fundamental characteristics of sound and the concept of musical notes and tones.**  

**Answer** -  
**Fundamental Characteristics of Sound**:  
1. **Frequency**:  
   - The number of vibrations per second, determining the pitch.  
   - Measured in Hertz (Hz). Higher frequencies produce higher-pitched sounds.  

2. **Amplitude**:  
   - Represents the energy of the sound wave, which correlates to loudness.  
   - Larger amplitudes produce louder sounds.  

3. **Timbre**:  
   - The unique quality of a sound that differentiates it from others, even at the same pitch and loudness.  

4. **Duration**:  
   - Refers to the length of time a sound is heard.  

**Concept of Musical Notes and Tones**:  
- **Musical Notes**:  
   - Discrete sounds with a specific pitch and duration, represented by symbols in musical notation (e.g., A, B, C).

### **Question 18 - What are the advantages of using the Luma-Chroma Transmission principle in video signals?**  

**Answer** -  
The **Luma-Chroma Transmission Principle** separates video signals into two components: luminance (brightness or grayscale information) and chrominance (color information).  

**Advantages**:  
1. **Efficient Bandwidth Usage**:  
   - Human vision is more sensitive to brightness than color. Transmitting chroma at lower resolutions saves bandwidth without significant quality loss.  

2. **Backward Compatibility**:
