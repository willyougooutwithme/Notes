### **1. Define session hijacking and list its challenges.**  
**Session hijacking** is a technique where an attacker takes over a user's session on a network. This is usually done by stealing or manipulating session cookies, which are used to authenticate users on websites or applications. Once the attacker gains access, they can impersonate the user and perform unauthorized actions.  

**Challenges:**  
- **Detection**: It's difficult to detect a session hijack until the damage is done.
- **Encryption Issues**: Unencrypted sessions are more vulnerable, but even encrypted ones can be attacked if SSL stripping is employed.  
- **Session Management**: Poor session timeout configurations make it easier for attackers to exploit idle sessions.  
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** Risks: Attackers can intercept active sessions in poorly secured networks.

### **2. What is a Feistel cipher? Briefly explain its structure.**  
The **Feistel cipher** is a symmetric encryption structure used in block ciphers, like DES (Data Encryption Standard). It divides plaintext into two halves and applies a series of processing rounds.  

**Structure:**  
1. Split the plaintext into two equal halves, **L0** and **R0**.  
2. For each round, apply a function **F** on one half and XOR the result with the other half:  
   - \( L_{i+1} = R_i \)  
   - \( R_{i+1} = L_i \oplus F(R_i, K_i) \)  
   \( K_i \) is the round key.
